# Recipes

A website to share my favorite recipes

It tries to cut all the crap of usual recipe websites.

Some of its features:
- Ingredients can be ticked off once added
- Steps can be highlighted for easier tracking 
- Screen stays awake on the recipe pages
- Also works fine without JavaScript (with reduced features)
